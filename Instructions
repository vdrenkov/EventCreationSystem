Event creation system
Generate a module named Events for the event creation system.
Create controller named Events that will handle individual endpoints.
The event must have properties: id, name, location, duration, number of guests.
Into the controller create four different methods which are:
路 getAllEventsByLocation() - Method: GET, Used to fetch the list of all products with the same location.
路 getEvent() - Method: GET, Used to retrieve the details of a particular event by
passing the eventID as a parameter.
路 addEvent() - Method: POST, Used to create and post a new event to the existing event list.
路 deleteEvent() - Method: DELETE, Used to delete a event by passing the eventID as a query parameter.
The EventsController must use a EventsService that is responsible for storing and retrieving data.
Use sqllite or other relational database for backend.
